//! Priority compile queue for the REX3 shader JIT.
//!
//! The async shader compiler used to take its work from a single bounded
//! `SyncSender`. A full channel dropped the request — a deliberate choice so the
//! GFIFO consumer thread never blocks — but that made no distinction between a
//! one-shot warm-up/prefetch shape and a shape the guest is drawing *right now*.
//! A boot-time flood of profile shapes could fill all 256 slots and starve the
//! shader IRIX was actually asking for, so the hot draw kept missing the JIT
//! and ran on the interpreter until the backlog drained.
//!
//! This queue gives the compiler two lanes:
//!
//! - a bounded **cold** lane for warm-up/prefetch. It is best-effort: when it is
//!   full a request is rejected, the caller drops the `Queued` marker, and a
//!   later draw retries (see `rules/testing/rex-jit-queue-retry.md`).
//! - an **hot** lane for whatever the draw path is asking for at dispatch time.
//!   The worker drains it before the cold lane and it is never rejected for a
//!   full queue, so live draw work cannot be starved by prefetch.
//!
//! The worker pops hot-first; [`CompileQueue::recv`] parks on a condvar rather
//! than spinning. The queue carries no Cranelift types, so it is defined outside
//! the `rex-jit` feature gate and its behaviour is unit-tested without a
//! compiler.
